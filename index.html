        <h3>Argento's triumvirate of ancient witches</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>The Three Mothers</strong> (Italian: <em>Le Tre madri</em>) is
          a trilogy of supernatural horror films by Italian filmmaker Dario
          Argento. It consists of <em>Suspiria</em>, <em>Inferno</em>, and
          <em>Mother of Tears</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The story of the Three Mothers opens at the beginning of the 11th
          century, when the origin of witchcraft is depicted as three sisters on
          the coast of the black sea. In the years that followed, they wandered
          the world and amassed great personal wealth and power, leaving death
          in their wake. The sisters are known as, <em>The Mothers</em>, hence
          the title of the trilogy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Mater Suspiriorum </strong>, the Mother of Sighs, is the
          oldest and wisest of the Three Mothers, her given name is Helena
          Markos. She is also known as The Black Queen.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Mater Tenebrarum</strong> , the Mother of Darkness, is the
          youngest and cruelest of the Three Mothers. Her true name is not
          given; her home is located in New York City and was christened in
          1910.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Mater Lachrymarum</strong>
          , the Mother of Tears, is the most beautiful and powerful of the Three
          Mothers. Like Tenebrarum, her true name is unknown. It is suggested
          that her home is in Rome, Italy.

            <h4>The Mother of Tears</h4>
            <p>
              An ancient urn is found in a cemetery outside Rome. Once opened,
              it triggers a series of violent incidents: robberies, rapes and
              murders increase dramatically, while several mysterious,
              evil-looking young women coming from all over the world are
              gathering in the city. All these events are caused by the return
              of Mater Lacrimarum, the last of three powerful witches who have
              been spreading terror and death for centuries. Alone against an
              army of psychos and demons, Sarah Mandy, an art student who seems
              to have supernatural abilities of her own, is the only person left
              to prevent the Mother of Tears from destroying Rome.

              Udo Kier played "Dr. Frank Mandel" in Suspiria in 1977 and
              returned to the Three Mothers trilogy 30 years later in this film,
              though as a different character, "Padre Johannes".
